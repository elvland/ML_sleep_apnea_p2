This project focusing on understanding, analyzing, and predicting OSA severity using machine learning techniques and statistical analysis applied to patient data. The goal was to uncover patterns and correlations within the dataset to aid in the development of predictive models for diagnosing and understanding OSA.

Mainly applying machine learning techniques, particularly regression and classification methods, to analyze and predict the severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) based on collected patient data. Using some key data science components for a project consiting of: 

Data Description and Preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Regression Analysis, Classification Analysis
